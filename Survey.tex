% Subject : Symbolic executions technique for finding bugs %
\title{A Survey of\\Symbolic Executions Techniques} % NB: I removed the "for finding bugs" because "bug" is not well-defined and we can clearly state in the introduction why we use symbolic execution.

  \section*{Abstract}
    % Describe paper's goals and content

  \section{Introduction}
    % What is symbolic execution and why do we do this survey

  \section{History}
    % Draft the history of symbolic execution, dig any trend up or whatever we can say about it.

  \section{Methods}
    % Begin with anything general to say (if any) then detail methods, could also be useful to compare them (if possible) and/or to say when/why a particular method is being used instead of another.
    % Maybe divide the general techniques and optimisations we can apply to all of them ?

  \section{Tools and languages}
    % Anything general to say bout the content (maybe explain the omnipresence of Microsoft in the market)
    % List tools and language, compare them if possible

  \section{Conclusions}
    % What can we get from this paper in general
    % Could be pertinent to talk about a kind of "to go further" which could contain adjacent fields of research
    % Could be pertinent to talk about the future of symbolic execution, if there is any new technique being developed, ...
